<p>
One of the strengths of the CPM is that it can incorporate different processes of interest
as separate "rules" given to the model. These rules can be mixed and matched to get a
simulation of interest, making the CPM a very flexible framework. Artistoo implements
a diverse set of model rules, called <a href="../identifiers.html#hamiltonian">Constraints</a>.
This tutorial will walk you through how to use these constraints in your models.
</p>


<h2 id="constraint-types">Soft versus hard constraints</h2>

<p>In Artistoo, we distinguish two types of constraints: <a href="#hard-constraints">"hard"
</a> and <a href="#soft-constraints">"soft"</a> constraints.</p>


<h3 id="soft-constraints">Soft constraints</h3>

<p>"Soft" constraints are the classical CPM energy rules. They are the terms of the
model's Hamiltonian, or energy equation. When a copy attempt would break such a rule,
this becomes visible as an energetic penalty making that copy attempt <i>less likely</i>.
But a soft constraint is more a guideline than an actual rule; the model will <i>mostly</i>
adhere to it, but not always.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we have a cell with a <a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/VolumeConstraint.js~VolumeConstraint.html">volume constraint</a>, and that
cell is already larger than its target volume. A copy attempt that would add another pixel
to that cell would be associated with a $&Delta;H_\text{vol} \gt 0$. However, that 
does <i>not</i> mean that this copy attempt will always fail to go through. First, it may
be that there are other constraints acting on the model for which this copy attempt <i>is</i>
favourable, compensating for the volume penalty such that the <i>global</i> $&Delta;H$
is still negative. Second, even if the global $&Delta;H$ is positive, a copy attempt may
still be accepted with a chance $e^{-&Delta;H T}$. Thus, soft constraints make some changes
more likely to happen than others, but they can balance each other out and are not always
listened to.</p>

<p>Most CPM constraints are soft constraints. But sometimes, there are things we would 
like to <i>forbid</i> completely. For that, we can use a hard constraint.</p>


<h3 id="hard-constraints">Hard constraints</h3>

<p>Whereas soft constraints are more guidelines than rules, "hard" constraints are set
in stone. Before the $&Delta;H$ of a copy attempt is even computed, Artistoo checks whether
it violates one of the hard constraints. If it does, it won't go through &mdash; ever.</p>

<p>Not many constraints are hard constraints, and in a typical CPM, you should be careful
using them. But examples are the <a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/HardVolumeRangeConstraint.js~HardVolumeRangeConstraint.html">
HardVolumeRangeConstraint</a>, the <a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/BarrierConstraint.js~BarrierConstraint.html">BarrierConstraint</a>, and the hard 
<a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/ConnectivityConstraint.js~ConnectivityConstraint.html">
ConnectivityConstraint</a>. See also this example of a 'particle' following a random walk,
where we constrained the volume such that the cell can only be one or two pixels big:</p>

<h2 id="adding-constraints">Adding a constraint to a model</h2>

<p>There are two ways of adding a constraint to your model, which we will explain here.</p>

<h3 id="method-1-conf">Method 1: via the conf object</h3>

<p> The first method is to add the relevant constraint parameters to the <code>conf</code>
object. This is the easiest method to add a constraint, but it only works for a few of the 
most used constraints (see <a href="../variable/index.html#static-variable-AutoAdderConfig"
>this page</a> for a list of the constraints for which this works). </p>


<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">let myCPM = new CPM.CPM(
	[ 200, 200 ],
	{
		T : 20,
		J : [[0,20],[20,0]],
		V : [0,500],
		LAMBDA_V: [ 0, 50]
	}

)</code></code></pre>

<p>will automatically create a CPM with an adhesion and a volume constraint inside it.
If we open the browser console from a page with an Artistoo simulation in it, e.g. 
<a href="../examples/ActModel.html">this one</a>, we can check this. Go to the page, 
right click anywhere on the page outside of the grid, select "inspect" and then "console". 
Copy-paste the above code in the 
console and hit enter. If you now type: </p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">myCPM.soft_constraints</code></code></pre>

<p>and hit enter, you should see that there are two soft constraints in the model now:
an <code>Adhesion</code> and a <code>VolumeConstraint</code>.</p>

<p>This works the same if we use the 
<a href="../class/src/simulation/Simulation.js~Simulation.html"><code>Simulation</code> class</a>,
because the <code>config.conf</code> is passed along internally to the CPM constructor.
So if we type:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">let mySim = new CPM.Simulation(
	{
		field_size : [200,200],
		conf : {
			T : 20,
			J : [[0,20],[20,0]],
			V : [0,500],
			LAMBDA_V: [ 0, 50]		
		},
		simsettings : {
			NRCELLS : [1]
		}
	}

)
mySim.C.soft_constraints</code></code></pre>

<p>we again see our two constraints appear.</p>


<h3 id="method-2-add">Method 2: via the add() method</h3>

<p>Note that, as mentioned, the first method does not work for all constraints. If we try to add
an <a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/AttractionPointConstraint.js~AttractionPointConstraint.html">
<code>AttractionPointConstraint</code></a> (another soft constraint) in this way:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">let myCPM = new CPM.CPM(
	[ 200, 200 ],
	{
		T : 20,
		J : [[0,20],[20,0]],
		V : [0,500],
		LAMBDA_V: [ 0, 50],
		LAMBDA_ATTRACTIONPOINT : [0,100],
		ATTRACTIONPOINT: [[0,0],[100,100]]
	}

)</code></code></pre>


<p>then if we type:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">myCPM.soft_constraints</code></code></pre>

<p>we still only have our <code>Adhesion</code> and a <code>VolumeConstraint</code>.
The <code>AttractionPointConstraint</code>has not been added.</p>

<p>To add this constraint, we must use the <a href="../class/src/models/CPM.js~CPM.html#instance-method-add">
<code>add()</code> method</a> of the CPM class. If we have already put the relevant parameters
in the <code>conf</code> object, this is easy:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">//add constraint
myCPM.add( new CPM.AttractionPointConstraint( myCPM.conf ) )
myCPM.soft_constraints</code></code></pre>

<p>you should now see an <code>AttractionPointConstraint</code> in the list of 
soft constraints. We've given the entire <code>conf</code> object of the CPM to the
constraint's constructor, but it will just ignore the parameters that are not relevant
to this constraint. However, we can also just give it it's own <code>conf</code> object.
For example, we might add a second attraction point like this:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">//add another constraint
myCPM.add( new CPM.AttractionPointConstraint( {
		LAMBDA_ATTRACTIONPOINT : [0,100],
		ATTRACTIONPOINT: [[0,0],[150,150]]	
} ) )
myCPM.soft_constraints</code></code></pre>

<p>You should now see two attraction point constraints in your list.</p>

<p>A word of warning: when you add a new constraint, the model will use it. It won't check
if another constraint of the same type was already present. For the example above, that's
perfectly fine because we might <i>want</i> to have two different points of attraction.
However, for other constraints such as the 
<a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/Adhesion.js~Adhesion.html"><code>Adhesion</code></a>,
this might not be what you want (basically, this will be the same as having only one
adhesion constraint where the parameters are twice as large. But someone checking your 
code may overlook your second adhesion constraint and think that the adhesion parameters 
are set lower than they actually are...).</p>


<h2 id="accessing-constraints">Accessing a constraint in your model</h2>

<p>Once you've put a constraint in your model, you may want to access it from outside.
The method <a href="../class/src/models/CPM.js~CPM.html#instance-method-getConstraint"><code>getConstraint()</code></a> allows you to do that. For
example:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">//get volumeconstraint
myCPM.getConstraint( "VolumeConstraint" )</code></code></pre>

<p>will return the <code>VolumeConstraint</code> that is currently in your model.</p>

<p>If there are multiple constraints of the same name in your model, this method
automatically gives you the first one:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">//get the first attraction point constraint
myCPM.getConstraint( "AttractionPointConstraint" )</code></code></pre>

<p>This yields the first attraction point we added (from the browser console, you can 
click the little triangle on the left to see more about the object. If you look at its
<code>conf</code> object, you see that this is the settings we gave to our first 
attraction point constraint).</p>

<p>If we want to access the second attraction point, we can type:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-$xslt"><code class="source-code prettyprint">//get the second attraction point constraint
myCPM.getConstraint( "AttractionPointConstraint", 1 )</code></code></pre>

<p><i>(Note here that JavaScript uses zero-based indexing, so an element with number
<code>1</code> is actually the second element)</i></p>



<h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation details</h2>
<p>Constraints in Artistoo are implemented as separate classes, of which an instance
can be added to a <a href="../class/src/models/CPM.js~CPM.html">CPM model</a> 
(See <a href="#adding-constraints">above</a> for an explanation how). The base
<a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/Constraint.js~Constraint.html"><code>Constraint</code></a>
class underlies all of them, and has two subclasses:  <a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/SoftConstraint.js~SoftConstraint.html"><code>SoftConstraint</code></a> and
<a href="../class/src/hamiltonian/HardConstraint.js~HardConstraint.html"><code>HardConstraint</code></a>.
These are never used by themselves, but can be extended to create a constraint
(see also <a href="./custommodules.html">this tutorial</a> to see how to develop custom modules).

<p>This manual contains detailed tutorials on how to use Artistoo to build your simulations.
We are still adding to it, so stay tuned for the most recent version! If you have questions
or would like to request a tutorial on some feature, get in touch using the
<a href="https://github.com/ingewortel/artistoo/discussions/categories/user-manual">discussion page of our GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>If you prefer a more hands on approach, you can also learn to use the framework by 
playing with the <a href="../examples.html">examples</a>
(with provided <a href="https://github.com/ingewortel/artistoo/tree/master/examples">code</a>).
For detailed documentation of all classes and methods, see the full 
<a href="../identifiers.html">documentation</a>. A guide for Artistoo developers 
will be made available at some point in the future, but until then, you can use the
documentation to get started and the <a href="https://github.com/ingewortel/artistoo/discussions">discussion page on GitHub</a>
to ask questions.</p>
